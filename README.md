# About Me

Hello! I'm a passionate Computer Science graduate, with both Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science from L'Aquila University, Italy, and Côte d'Azur University in France, respectively. I graduated with the highest honors (110 e lode) in my Master's program, focusing on Ubiquitous Networking. My journey through academia and professional engagements has always been driven by an insatiable curiosity and a firm belief in continuous learning and applying what I learn in practical settings.

Throughout my studies, I delved into fascinating areas such as Quantum Computing —culminating in a thesis on Quantum Computing Algorithms— and contributed to significant projects like the evolution of social graphs over time with the INRIA’s COATI team and, as developer at Amadeus for Inetum, I contributed to the internal test infrastructure of the company, a challenging experience which expanded my expertise. In my spare time, I enjoy challenging myself with Capture The Flag competitions, indicative of my passion for cybersecurity. 

My work has spanned developing RESTful services, engaging with web development frameworks, cloud technologies, diving in cybersecurity topics, alongside the study of linear programming and exploring various programming languages and much more. 

My journey is documented through various projects and milestones here on my GitHub, which serves as a digital testament to my growth and learning in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

But who am I beyond the code? I'm a bass guitar player, blending melodies and rhythms much like I blend algorithms and technologies. My experiences as a rugby player taught me the importance of teamwork and resilience, traits that I bring to every project I undertake. I'm also an avid traveler and hiker, finding inspiration in the landscapes I explore and the cultures I encounter. I'm a voracious reader and cinephile and I love immersing myself in video games as well, seeing them not just as entertainment but as worlds of endless possibilities and learning.
